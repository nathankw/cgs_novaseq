# Making an instance for running bcl2fastq2. bcl2fastq2 requires at least 32GB RAM. 
Since a flowcell for a NovaSeq can result in upto 3TB of data, the instance will need at least that
much RAM or persistant disk. One option is to create an instance with upto 3TB of local SD (the max).
That would require attaching 8 devices of local SSD, each of which is 375GB. 
Here is an example command that a cloud function could call to run the job that tars and uploads
the run directory to cloud storage:

gcloud compute instances create-with-container img-name
  --image compute-goldenv2-7
  --local-ssd
  --service-account
  --description "Tar and upload run directory to cloud storage."
  --labels workflow=sequencer,stage=store_run
  --network development
  --network-interface subnet=10.249.16.0/27 
  --tags no-ip
  --zone $ZONE
